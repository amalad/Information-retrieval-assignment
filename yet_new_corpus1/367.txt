
control system and analysis and design via the second method of
lyapunov .

kalman, r. e. and bertram, j. e.

thesecond methodof lyapunov is the most general approach currently in
the theory of stability of dynamic systems . after a rigorous exposition
 of the fundamental concepts of this theory, applications are made toa
stability of linear stationary, linear nonslationary, and nonlinear
systems,.bestimation of transient behavior,.ccontrol-system
optimization,.ddesign of relay servos . the discussion is essentially
self-contained, with emphasis on the thorough development of the
principal ideas and mathematical tools . only systems governed by
differential equations are treated here . systems governed by difference
equations are the subject of a companion paper .
