hoshizaki, h.

the main purpose of this investigation is to examine the dependence of
heat transfer in planetary atmospheres on the total enthalpy up to
flight velocities of 50,000 ftsec where a large proportion of the atoms
 are ionized . the total thermodynamic and transport property concept
discussed by hirshfelder j.chem.phys.,262,feb.,1957 is used .
